I was planning on continuing my blog post on Gossip Protocols tonight however an old friend decided to pay
an unexpected visit. Instead, I'm going to express my thoughts on a post I read titled
[Write Less Code](http://mikegrouchy.com/blog/2012/06/write-less-code.html) by Mike Grouchy.

Reading his post made me remember my own evolution as a software developer. Some of the traps he describes I still suffer
from. Often I run into situations where I find myself hacking away at something I haven't thought through. What happens?
I end up deleting the code and it never sees production. I've wasted so much energy in the past falling into this trap I still 
suffer from it today but slowly learning to avoid it.

I know for sure my boss is a very experienced software developer. He spends an enormous amount of time on research.
This seems weird to me because I actually never see him programming, he's constantly reading or whiteboarding things.
When I do see him program or work on something he's able to crank out elegant solutions to problems because of
the amount of research and thinking he's done beforehand. 

I need to remember that **code is a by-product**. Thinking things out before
hacking away seems obvious but I still find myself slipping from time to time. 
I'll try keeping this in mind and remember that my real job is to think 
and write less code.
